    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Kamerron Pace for the past 8 weeks I have been working vigorously  to learn javascript, html and css. I have always had a knack for tech. If it was not me fixing something or learning something I was in some way doing something connected to tech.A long term goal of mine is to be employed at a big tech company where I lead a team of talented data center security technicians. The passion and skill I can bring to your company is one to no other. I strenuously try each day to be better than yesterday. The people around me who look up to me take it with great stride to move forward and never give up. When I'm at your company I plan on doing no less than astounding work. </p>
